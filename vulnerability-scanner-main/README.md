# 🔒 Vulnerability Scanner — Secure Coding Review

This repository contains the original and improved versions of a Python-based vulnerability scanner developed and audited as part of the **Code Alpha Cyber Security Internship** Secure Coding Review task.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The project demonstrates:
- **Port scanning** for open TCP ports on a target IP.
- **HTTP header analysis** to check for security-related headers.

As part of the Secure Coding Review task:
1. The **original code** (`scanner.py`) was analyzed for security vulnerabilities.
2. **Automated scans** were performed using:
   - [Bandit](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/) — Python static security analysis.
   - [pip-audit](https://pypi.org/project/pip-audit/) — Dependency vulnerability scanner.
3. **Manual review** was conducted to find additional issues.
4. **A secure version** (`scanner_secure.py`) was created with fixes and best practices.

## 🛠 Features in Secure Version
- Input validation for IP addresses and URLs.
- Request timeouts to prevent hangs.
- SSL certificate verification enabled by default.
- Optional `--allow-insecure` flag for testing with warnings.
- Configurable port scan range and delay.
- Structured logging instead of print statements.
- CLI argument parsing with `argparse`.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
It’s recommended to use a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
Install updated dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements_secure.txt
2️⃣ Run Secure Scanner
Port Scan Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
python scanner_secure.py 192.168.1.10
Header Analysis Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
python scanner_secure.py https://example.com
Header Analysis with Insecure SSL (Testing Only):

bash
Copy
Edit
python scanner_secure.py https://self-signed.badssl.com --allow-insecure
🔍 Running Security Scans
Run Bandit:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m bandit -r scanner.py
Run pip-audit:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m pip_audit
📊 Key Findings from Original Code
High Severity: Disabled SSL certificate verification (verify=False).

Medium Severity: No timeout set for HTTP requests.

Weak input validation, no error handling in port scan, and no rate limiting.

Outdated dependencies (requests, urllib3) with known vulnerabilities.

✅ Improvements in Secure Version
Removed insecure verify=False by default.

Added timeout to all HTTP requests.

Robust IP/URL validation using regex and urlparse.

Exception handling for socket and HTTP errors.

Logging with configurable verbosity.

Pinned dependencies to safe versions.
